ACCURATE ASSESSMENT [General]
You can accurately judge how good someone is at something.
Benefit: Select a target creature within 60'. By taking a standard action you can learn one current statistical
value of the target (such as an ability score, skill bonus, hit points, armor class, etc… anything that has a
numeric value). This action does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Notes: A statistical value is anything in a stat block or character sheet represented by a formula or numerical
value. The value learned is the current modified value.

ACROBATIC [General]
You are a natural acrobat.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Jump checks and Tumble checks.

ACROBATIC CHARGE [General, Fighter]
Your unexpected attacks have great effect.
Prerequisite: Dodge, Mobility, Tumble 1 rank, Base attack bonus +3
Benefit: You may tumble a distance equal to your speed as part of a charge, avoiding attacks of opportunity
as described in the Tumble skill. If you succeed at the Tumble check, and if you make a bull rush, trip,
disarm or grapple attack as part of this charge, you gain an additional +2 circumstance bonus to your attack
roll and to any other rolls necessary for the maneuver, such as the opposed ability check for a trip attack.
You may not use Acrobatic Charge on consecutive rounds.
Normal: You may only Tumble as part of a normal move.

ACROBATIC STRIKE [General]
You may use your acrobatic skill to catch your enemy off guard.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Tumble 4 ranks
Benefit: As a standard action, you may make a Tumble check against a DC of 15 + your opponent's Hit Dice.
If you succeed, you then make a single melee attack against your opponent who is denied their Dexterity
bonus to AC for this attack only (and hence subject to sneak attack damage). If you fail the Tumble check
you fall prone and make no attack.
Special: You remain in the same spot when using this ability, whether you succeed or not.

AGILE [General]
You are especially agile.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Balance checks and Escape Artist checks.

ALERTNESS [General]
You are very aware of your surroundings.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Listen checks and Spot checks.

AMBIDEXTERITY [Trait]
You are more effective with your off hand.
Benefit: When dual, double or multi-weapon fighting you may add your full strength bonus to all attacks.

ANIMAL AFFINITY [General]
You have a natural rapport with animals.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Handle Animal checks and Ride checks.

ANYTHING GOES COMBAT [General, Fighter]
In your hands almost anything is a dangerous weapon
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Int 13
Benefit: You are the master of the improvised weapon. You may treat any object, including weapons you are
not proficient with, as simple melee weapons using the stats listed in this feat instead of the stats usually
used for that object or weapon, although you may still use weapons you have proficiency with as per normal.
Determine the size of the object or weapon and use the stats listed here. All weapons threaten a critical hit
on a 20 and do double damage. No weapon gives you reach. As stated in the SRD, a light weapon is
generally two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon one size smaller, and a two-
handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.

APOTHECARY [General]
You have extensive knowledge of poisons and how to distill and manufacture them.
Benefit: You can create any poison following the craft rules using your Craft (alchemy) or Profession
(herbalist) skills, with a DC equal to the save DC of the poison, except that each skill check represents one
day's (rather than one week's) work. Many poisons require more expensive or rare components, as decided
by your DM.

ARMED DEFLECT ARROWS [General, Fighter]
You can deflect arrows, including crossbow bolts, spears and other shot or thrown weapons with your
chosen weapon.
Benefit: You gain the use of the Deflect Arrows feat, but can only use this ability when wielding a melee
weapon that you have Weapon Focus with.

ARMED FLURRY OF BLOWS [Martial Style]
You can attack with a flurry of blows with any weapon that you are proficient in.
Benefit: This feat expands on your Flurry of Blows ability, allowing you to flurry with any weapon that you are
proficient in.
Normal: Flurry of Blows can normally only be used in unarmed combat or when armed with a kama,
nunchaku or siangham.


ARMOR SKIN [Epic, Fighter]
Your skin is much tougher than normal for your race.
Benefit: You gain a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor Class, or your existing natural armor bonus increases
by 1.

ASTROLOGER [General]
You can divine the future using elements of nature and the state of the heavens.
Prerequisite: Wis 13, Knowledge (Planes) 4 ranks, Knowledge (Arcana) 4 ranks
Benefit: You may spend 5 minutes studying the heavens or some other chosen fortune telling focus in order
to duplicate the effects of the Augury spell. Your caster level is always considered 0 and thus the success
rate is a fixed 70%. You may use this feat a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus.

ATHLETIC [General]
You are a natural athlete.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Climb checks and Swim checks.

ATTACK FOCUS [General, Fighter]
You may sacrifice mobility and attacks to increase your ability to hit.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: With a full attack, give up all your attacks but one for the round. This single attack gets a +2 bonus,
plus an additional +2 bonus for each attack you gave up.
Example: Alan, with a base attack bonus of +12, can normally make three attacks in a round, at +12, +7, and
+2. With Attack Focus, he can make a single attack at +18, a +6 bonus (+2 for the feat, +2 for each of the
two attacks he gave up).

AUGMENTED ALCHEMY [Epic]
Your alchemical creations are especially potent.
Prerequisite: Int 21, Craft (alchemy) 24 ranks
Benefit: Whenever creating an alchemical item or substance, you can choose to make it more powerful than
normal by adding +20 to the DC required to create it and multiplying its price by 5. If the item or substance
deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn't deal damage, double the duration
of its effect. If the item or substance doesn't deal damage and doesn't have a specific listed duration (or has
an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn't fit any of these
categories, then it cannot be affected by this feat. See the Craft (alchemy) skill description.

AURA CHAMELEON [General]
You may fool divination spells, or powers, in the same way as you can decieve magic items.
Prerequisite: Cha 13, Disguise 5 ranks, Bluff 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 5 ranks
Benefit: While in disguise and as part of a role, you may attempt to use your Use Magic Device skill to
disguise your aura to emulate any, or all, of the following: Ability Score (DC 15+Score); Alignment (DC 30);
Class Feature (DC 20); Race (DC 25); Spell Ability (DC 20). You have to make your Use Magic Item roll
each time someone tests your disguise (by casting a detection spell), and you have to decide how you wish
divination spells, or supernatural senses, to 'read' you beforehand. If not using the psionics/magic
transparency rules, Use Magic Device cannot emulate psionics and Use Psionic Device cannot emulate
magic.
Special: While in disguise and as part of a role, you may, and with DM permission, attempt to use your Use
Psionic Device skill to disguise your aura to emulate any, or all, of the following: Ability Score (DC
15+Score); Alignment (DC 30); Psionic Class Feature (DC 25); Psionic Feat (DC 20); Psionic Power (DC
20).

AVOIDANCE [General, Fighter]
You do not provoke attacks of opportunity moving past opponents.
Prerequisite: Dex 15, Base attack bonus +6, Tumble 8 ranks, Dodge, Expertise, Mobility, Spring Attack
Benefit: You do not draw attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened squares.
Special: This feat can only be executed in light or no armor.
Notes: This is not considered tumbling. You move at your normal movement rate. This feat does not allow
you to move through enemy occupied squares.

AWARENESS [General]
By intuitively predicting your opponent's next move, you can get the jump on them.
Prerequisite: Wis 13
Benefit: You may use your wisdom bonus instead of your dexterity bonus to determine your initiative bonus.

AWESOME BLOW [Monster, Fighter]
You knock your victims flying with a powerful attack.
Prerequisite: Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull Rush, Size Large or larger
Benefit: As a standard action, the creature may choose to subtract 4 from its melee attack roll and deliver an
awesome blow. If the creature hits a corporeal opponent smaller than itself with an awesome blow, its
opponent must succeed on a Reflex save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of
the attacking creature's choice and fall prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent in a
straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the attacking creature than the square it started in. If an
obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6
points of damage, and the opponent stops in the space adjacent to the obstacle.
Special: This can be taken as a fighter bonus feat.

AXE FRENZY [General, Fighter]
You can strike exceptionally fast with axes.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus (any One Axe Weapon)
Benefit: You can only get the benefit of this feat with an axe-type weapon you have Weapon Focus in and
use in one hand. Make one extra attack with an axe per round at your highest base attack. You suffer a –4
dodge penalty to AC during this round. This requires the full attack action.
Special: This feat works with the dwarven waraxe, greataxe, handaxe, kukiri, and throwing axe.

AXE HURLING [General, Fighter]
You can throw any axe.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus (any One Axe Weapon)
Benefit: You can throw any type of axe that you have Weapon Focus for as if it had a range increment of 20
ft.
Special: This feat works with the battleaxe, dwarven waraxe, greataxe, handaxe, kukiri, and throwing axe.


BACK TO BACK [General, Fighter]
You shield your allies' vulnerabilities in combat.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +2
Benefit: If you are adjacent to an ally, that ally cannot be flanked. If you are adjacent to more than one ally,
you must choose one ally to protect in this manner.


BACKSTAB [Stealth]
You are adept at sneak attacks.
Prerequisite: Sneak Attack 1d6
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls when making a sneak attack.


BANE OF ENEMIES [Epic, Special]
Your favored enemies fear any weapon in your hands.
Prerequisite: Survival 24 ranks, Five favored enemies
Benefit: Any weapon you wield against one of you favored enemies is treated as a bane weapon for that
creature type (thus, its enhancement bonus is increased by +2 and it deals +2d6 points of damage). This
ability doesn't stack with similar abilities.


BATTLE CRY [General, Fighter]
Your voice inspires greatness in battle.
Prerequisite: Cha 15
Benefit: Whenever you use the charge special attack, you may let lose an inspiring battle-cry. If you hit your
target, all your allies that can hear you within 60' get a +1 morale bonus to hit until your next action.


BATTLE LEADER [General]
Your banner or standard inspires your followers and cohorts in battle
Prerequisite: Cha 13, Leadership
Benefit: For this feat to have an effect, you must have a banner or standard that is recognizable to your
followers and cohorts, and you must use this standard to urge, inspire or rally your troops. All cohorts and
followers that can directly see you or your banner gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls and on saving
throws versus all fear effects. If either you or your banner falls, all followers and cohorts instead get a -2
penalty to attack and on saving throws versus all fear effects until you are restored, the standard is raised
again or one minute elapses.


BEAST TONGUES [General]
You can speak despite your form.
Benefit: As long as you can produce sound, this feat allows you to speak, even if your form would not
ordinarily allow it. This is applicable to monsters that normally lack speech or if you are polymorphed into
such a shape. You can now speak any language you know and cast spells with verbal components in any
form. You can even sing and use bardic music in any form.

BLEEDING CRITICAL [General, Fighter]
Your strikes can cause someone to bleed to death.
Prerequisite: Improved Critical, Base attack bonus +8
Benefit: When dealing a critical hit your target takes 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss. The
critical hit does not multiply the Constitution damage.
Special: Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and constructs) are immune to this Constitution
damage. This applies even if you have some other ability (such as the Enable Criticals feat) that lets you
score critical hits against them.


BLIND [General]
Being blind, you have developed other senses to compensate.
Prerequisite: Permanently blind for at least three months
Benefit: You gain +4 to all Listen checks, and the ability to take 10 on any Listen check, regardless of
condition. Listen is considered a class skill for you. You also gain the feat Blind-Fight.
Special: If you ever recover your sight, you lose this feat but keep Blind-Fight.

BLIND-FIGHT [General, Fighter]
You can sense opponents that you cannot see.
Benefit: In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile
roll one time to see if you actually hit. An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in
melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2
bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however. You
take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general
reduces your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half.
Normal: Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity
bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies.
Special: The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell. A fighter may
select Blind-Fight as one of his fighter bonus feats.


BLIND-SHOT [General]
You can sense your targets using senses other than sight.
Prerequisite: Blind-fight
Benefit: When making a ranged attack against a target within 30' you may re-roll your miss chance due to
concealment if you fail the first time.

BLINDING SPEED [Epic]
You can act with near superhuman speed.
Prerequisite: Dex 25
Benefit: You can act as if hasted for 5 rounds each day. The duration of the effect need not be consecutive
rounds. Activating this power is a free action.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she takes the feat, it grants an
additional 5 rounds of haste per day.


BLINDING STRIKE [General]
Your mastery of underhanded dishonorable tactics allows you to temporarily blind your foe.
Prerequisite: Brawl, Streetfighting, Base attack bonus +2
Benefit: By taking a full attack action, you may make a single attack that blinds your foe. If you hit, your
opponent must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half your level) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Only creatures
that use sensory organs to see are vulnerable to this attack.


BLINDSIGHT, 5-FT. RADIUS [General]
You can sense everything close to you, visible or not.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +4, Blind-fight, Wis 19
Benefit: Using senses such as acute hearing and sensitivity to vibrations, you detect the location of
opponents who are no more than 5 feet away from you. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though you
cannot discern incorporeal beings.


BLOODLETTING [General, Fighter]
Your strikes can cause someone to bleed to death.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus
Benefit: When dealing a critical hit with any weapon you have taken Weapon Focus for, your opponent
begins bleeding, suffering 1 additional point of damage each round until the wound is treated. The wound
can be closed with a successful Heal check (DC 15), or any magical healing. This effect is cumulative but a
single Heal check or magical heal will stop all current effects from this feat on that target.

BONDED WEAPON [General, Fighter]
You have used a single weapon so much that you have formed an almost spiritual bond with that specific
weapon.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +8, Improved Critical (with Weapon), Proficient With Weapon, Weapon
Focus (with Weapon), Weapon Specialization (with Weapon)
Benefit: Choose a single unique weapon. For one month you train exclusively with that weapon, learning
how to best wield that specific weapon most effectively. During the training period, you may use no other
weapons or you must repeat the process. After the month of training, give the weapon a name to symbolize
your intimate knowledge of the weapon. You gain an additional +2 to all attack rolls and +1 to damage with
your named weapon (this stacks with the weapon focus and weapon specialization bonuses). You do not
gain the bonuses or penalties of this feat when wielding a weapon of the same type, and suffer a -2 to all
attack rolls with all other weapons.
Special: If ever your named weapon is destroyed or taken from your possession for more than a week, you
must repeat the process of naming a weapon and continue to suffer the -2 to attack rolls with all weapons of
a different type. You may never have more than one bonded weapon.



BOOKWORM [General]
You seem to have a knack for locating information needed when performing research
Benefit: Gain a +3 modifier to any research based activities conducted in a library or laboratory.
Special: This feat stacks with all skill and research enhancements applicable


BOTTOMS UP [General]

opportunity.


BOW MASTERY [General, Fighter]
You are adept with either bows or crossbows.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus (any Bow Or Crossbow), Base attack bonus +3
Benefit: You can choose to apply this feat to either bows or crossbows, but not both (unless this feat is taken
twice). If you have previously taken Weapon Focus (any bow), you can apply the +1 attack bonus gained
from this feat when wielding any bow that you are proficient in. Similarly, if you have previously chosen
Weapon Focus (any crossbow), you can apply the +1 attack bonus gained from this feat when wielding any
crossbow that you are proficient in.
Special: This feat can be chosen twice but does not stack with itself. The second time it is chosen you must
apply its effects to either bows or crossbows, whichever wasn't chosen the first time this feat was taken.


BRAVERY [General]
You are especially resistant to fear effects.
Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus to all saves to resist and/or overcome fear effects.


BRAWL [General, Fighter]
You have a talent for unarmed fighting.
Benefit: When making an unarmed attack, you receive a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, and you deal
nonlethal damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
Normal: Unarmed attacks normally deal nonlethal damage equal to 1d3 + Strength modifier.
Special: Even if you have the ability to treat unarmed damage as lethal damage, the damage when using
Brawl is always nonlethal.

You have improved your striking power.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Brute
Benefit: When calculating melee attack bonus, consider your Strength to be two points higher than it actually
is.

BREAKING BLOW [Martial Style]
You are capable of inflicting powerful attacks with your bare hands.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +5, Str 15, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, Fists Of Steel
Benefit: As a full round action you may make a single unarmed melee attack that if it hits, deals damage
equal to 1d6 for each point of strength modifier you have. If applied to an inanimate object, the damage is
doubled. This uses one of your Stunning Fist attempts.
Special: The damage from a Breaking Blow is not modified by any statistic, ability, or feat, is applied instead
of normal damage, and is not doubled by a critical hit.


BRUTE [General, Fighter]
You have improved your striking strength.
Prerequisite: Str 13
Benefit: When calculating damage inflicted, consider your Strength to be two points higher than it actually is.


BUTTERFLY FLANK [General, Fighter]
Your skill with a blade distracts and intimidates your opponent, catching them off balance and unaware.
Prerequisite: Dex 15, Combat Reflexes, Lightning Reflexes, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: As long as you and an ally threaten the same opponent, but are not adjacent to one another, your
opponent is considered flanked to you and all allies threatening them.
Normal: A character can only flank an opponent if he and an ally are directly opposite one another around
the target.

CALLED SHOT [General, Fighter]
You do more damage with pinpoint attacks.
Prerequisite: Dex 13
Benefit: On your action, before making attack rolls for the round, you may choose to subtract a number from
all attack rolls for the round and add the same number to all weapon damage rolls for dexterity-based
attacks. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage
apply until your next action.
Special: Creatures lacking an anatomy and thus immune to critical hits, are immune to this extra damage.
Called shot can be used with ranged weapons at ranges up to 30 feet.
Notes: Dexterity-based attacks are attacks that use the dexterity modifier rather than the strength modifier for
attack rolls; missile weapons, thrown weapons and weapons used with the Weapon Finesse feat. Called
shot cannot be used with ranged touch attacks.

CAMOUFLAGE [General]
You have mastered the art of concealing objects and other creatures.
Prerequisite: Hide 1 rank
Benefit: You can apply your Hide skill to objects or even other creatures as a standard action. Often this
requires arranging scenery to provide superior concealment. All normal Hide modifiers, including size, apply.
A creature hidden in this manner cannot move about without breaking concealment.
Notes: Your DM may allow anyone to use the Hide skill for this, without requiring a feat.

CAMPAIGNER [General]
You sleep well under any circumstances.
Prerequisite: Endurance
Benefit: You can sleep in any kind of armor for any amount of time without suffering fatigue penalties or
discomfort. Other conditions that are uncomfortable but not dangerous, such as temperature, noise, sleeping
on a hard surface, or with bed bugs, will likewise not prevent you from a good nights sleep. You get to make
listen rolls normally while asleep. On any successful roll, you instantly wake up. You fall asleep easily, so you
still get your rest even if you wake up several times.
Notes: This incorporates the Improved Rapid Metabolism, Improved Recovery and Light Sleeper feats from
previous versions of the Netbook of Feats.

CAREFUL PLANNER [General]
You always seem to have the right equipment on hand.
Prerequisite: Wis 13
Benefit: In any situation where a piece of mundane equipment is required and the item is unavailable, you
can declare that you have the item on hand. You must immediately pay for the item, as if purchased from a
shop. The item in question cannot be more than 25 gp in value. It is a fairly typical item of its sort you
purchased last time you were in an appropriate market. The item found is not a specific item and could not
for instance appear to be a counterfeit of another specific item. In the case of arrows, darts and the like, you
may not 'find' more than 1d10 of these on you at any one time.
Special: You may use this feat a number of times per session equal to your Wisdom bonus. However, the
DM may determine on extensive excursions that it can only be used a number of times equal to your Wisdom
bonus per adventure. You can not find an item that you could not have conceivably been carrying with you
because you lack sufficient storage space.
Notes: The idea of the feat is not that you magically create items, but that your character is a better shopper
than their player and bought the item last time they re-supplied even the player had not thought to do so.

CAST-IRON STOMACH [General]
You can consume the most unpleasant fare without so much as a second thought.
Prerequisite: Con 13
Benefit: You derive nourishment from spoiled food and can avoid dehydration by drinking seawater with few
ill effects. By subsisting on these unusual provisions, you double the amount of time you can go without fresh
food and water.
Normal: Without this feat you can go without food for three days, after which time you must make a
Constitution check (DC 10, + 1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Without this
feat you can go without fresh water for one day plus a number of hours equal to your Constitution score,
after which you must make Constitution checks as described above, with similar effects for failed checks.
Special: For this feat to take effect, you must have access to formerly edible foods and a supply of salt water.
Otherwise, you are just as vulnerable to starvation and dehydration as any other character.


CHAOTIC MIND [General]
The turbulence of your thoughts prevents others from gaining insight into your actions.
Prerequisite: Chaotic alignment, Cha 15
Benefit: Creatures and characters who have an insight bonus on their attack rolls, an insight bonus to their
Armor Class, or an insight bonus on skill checks or ability checks do not gain those bonuses against you.
The benefit of this feat applies only to insight bonuses gained from psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This
is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.
Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point
reserve or psi-like abilities).

CHAOTIC RAGE [Epic, Rage]
Your rage channels the powers of raw chaos into your weapon.
Prerequisite: Rage 5/day, Chaotic alignment
Benefit: Any weapon you wield while in a rage is treated as an anarchic weapon (it is chaos-aligned and

similar abilities.

You lead a charmed existence.
Benefit: One time per day, you may add a +4 bonus to any single die roll. You must choose to do this before
rolling.



CHILD OF THE SEA [General, Trait]

you. You can always Take 10 on your Swim check skills. You may use the run action when swimming, but
only if you swim in a straight line.
Special: You may only take this feat at character creation.
Notes: You do not gain any ability to breathe underwater.

CLEAVE [General, Fighter]
You can slice through multiple foes in one great swing.
Prerequisite: Power Attack, Str 13
Benefit: If you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points
or killing it), you get an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature within reach. You cannot take
a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same
bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature. You can use this ability once per round.
Special: A fighter may select Cleave as one of his fighter bonus feats.

CLEAVE ASUNDER [General, Fighter]
Your Sunder attacks are usually more effective. You are trained in following through when you break an
opponent's weapon or shield
Prerequisite: Str 13, Cleave, Improved Sunder, Power Attack
Benefit: When attacking an opponent's weapon, shield or other held object, if the object is broken you can
immediately make another attack against the same opponent or another object the opponent holds. You can
use this ability only once per round.

You charge forward cutting through all in your path.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Dex 13, Power Attack, Cleave, Dodge, Great Cleave, Mobility, Spring Attack, Base
attack bonus +8
Benefit: As a full round action you may trace a path up to twice your speed in a straight line. This path must
be generally clear; the only obstructions allowed are friendly or enemy combatants. You must attack the first

may can take a cleave attack on the next available target. If no targets are in reach you may continue
moving along the path. You must stop moving when you make an attack but fail to drop the opponent. Any
opponent dropped will not hinder your movement even if they originally blocked your path. You are
considered to be charging and get the usual +2 bonus to hit on all attacks for the round, and -2 to your AC
until your next action. You still provoke attacks of opportunity as usual.
Special: This feat does not allow this maneuver to be used while mounted.


CLEAVING SHOT [General, Fighter]
Your missile attacks can pierce through one target and into the next.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus, Point Blank Shot, Base attack bonus +8
Benefit: If you hit an opponent within 30' with a ranged attack and deal enough damage to drop the target,
you missile rips through your target and potentially strikes a second foe. You may immediately make another
attack at the same base attack bonus against an enemy within 30' of you and who is in a direct line with you
and your original target.
Notes: As a DM you may want to restrict this feat to ranged weapons you feel could realistically "rip through"
a target, however one could imagine that a thrown axe might whiz by cutting someone's throat instead of
blasting through their chest.


CLOAK DANCE [General]
You are skilled at using optical tricks to make yourself seem to be where you are not.
Prerequisite: Hide 10 ranks, Perform (dance) 2 ranks
Benefit: You can take a move action to obscure your exact position. Until your next turn, you have

You are cold-blooded slayer, able to precisely kill others with devastating sneak attacks.
Prerequisite: Death Attack, Base attack bonus +7, Sneak Attack 1d6

COMBAT ARCHERY [Epic, Fighter]
You can fire a bow without incurring attacks of opportunity.
Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot, Dodge, Mobility
Benefit: You do not incur any attacks of opportunity for firing a bow when threatened.

Benefit: You get a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while on

next action.

attack action to take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

yourself open to others.

Benefit: When you make an attack of opportunity, you may add sneak attack damage. This ability can only
be used once per round, and following this attack, you may not make any further Attacks of Opportunity until
after your next action. This may negate the benefits of Combat Reflexes for the current round.
Normal: Only the loss of Dex bonus to Armor Class or flanked status allow a character to add sneak attack
damage.
Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies
to a new weapon.

COMBAT PRECISION [General, Fighter]
You can sacrifice power for accuracy.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Base attack bonus +1
Benefit: When taking an attack or full attack action you can choose to use Combat Precision. Until your next

attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.

COMBAT SURGE [General, Fighter]
You can rush an action in combat at the cost of presenting opportunities to your opponents
Prerequisite: Improved Initiative, Base attack bonus +2

leading a flanking effort against a single opponent, your allies involved in the melee gain a +4 flanking bonus
on the attack roll.
Normal: Gain a +2 on your attack roll when flanking
Special: You must be able to effectively communicate with the other flanking members.
Notes: This feat is designed to let a leader coordinate a better attack front against an opponent. By confusing
the opponent and having the group work together under the direction of the leader, the flanking bonus
increases.

CONTROLLED CHARGE [General, Fighter]
You can still remain defensive when charging.
Benefit: You are able to make a charge attack without suffering a -2 penalty to armor class.

COUNTER CHARGE [General, Fighter]
You may step forward and meet a charging opponent, using his momentum to make your own attack more
effective.

Benefit: You may declare a Counter Charge as a readied action against any opponent who charges you. The
action is triggered the moment your opponent comes within 5' of your reach. You take a 5' step forward and
make a single attack at your full base attack bonus. Your opponent suffers the -2 AC penalty for charging.
On a successful attack you deal double damage. Stack this bonus damage with the weapon's critical
multiplier on a critical hit. While this shortens the distance your opponent has to charge, it does not alter the
bonuses and penalties of the charge if the opponent moves less than 10' because of your action.
Normal: Normally, you may only deal double damage against a charging opponent with weapons that may
be set against charging foes.
Special: If for any reason you may not take the 5-foot step, you may not use this feat.

against a target who moves more than 5' and moves through your threatened area in a manner that does not
normally provoke an attack of opportunity.

attack of opportunity from the attacker's target. You get no attacks of opportunity against a target with at
least 50% cover.
Notes: If you have made even a single attack of opportunity since your last action, you may not use this feat,
since you can no longer give up ALL attacks of opportunity. If the target has the feat Mobility, the mobility
bonus to AC still applies.

elect to disable one of that creature's natural attacks. If the creature uses this natural attack in a round, it
takes a -5 penalty on all attack rolls for that round. If it avoids using that attack, any other attacks it makes
are not penalized. This penalty lasts until the creature receives a DC 15 Heal check, receives magical
healing, regeneration, or is healed by rest.

CROSS-CLASS LEARNING [General]
Pick two skills that become class skills for all your classes.
Benefit: Pick any two skills. The selected skills become class skills for all your classes from this point on.

your words.
Normal: To Demoralize Opponent you must threaten them in melee combat.

much as a -5 penalty to Armor Class to add the same number (up to +5) to a single attack roll in the same

roll d% to see if you lose 1 hit point each round. When reduced to negative hit points, you may choose to act
as if you were disabled, rather than dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to
negative hit points (even if it isn't your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you
immediately fall unconscious. When using this feat, you can take either a single move or standard action
each turn, but not both, and you cannot take a full round action. You can take a move action without further
injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other action deemed as strenuous, including
some free actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If

touch attack at your highest unarmed attack bonus against any opponent within 30 ft. A successful attack roll
inflicts force damage equal to your base unarmed strike damage, modified by your Wis bonus. Your strength
bonus does not add to your attack or damage roll. This can be combined with all other special monk

bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of bonuses.

undead and are using an attack that does not suffer a miss chance against incorporeal opponents (like a
ghost touch weapon), you can score critical hits against incorporeal undead.
Notes: This also allows you to use abilities and actions that only work against creatures subject to critical
hits, such as Coup de Grace, Sneak Attack and the ranger's Favored Enemy damage bonus. A construct,
object, or undead need never make a Fortitude save to survive a coup-de-grace.

and undead).
Normal: Your dexterity bonus applies only to your attack roll.

check.

think you are about to cast the spell being faked.
Notes: If the spell effect would have been unnoticeable (such as most divination spells) or you can fake the
effects of the spell (perhaps through illusion, alchemical pyrotechnics or a willing accomplice), people
watching you will generally believe the spell was real. Bluff, Perform, Craft (alchemy) and several other skills
may be helpful in achieving this, but faking the spell effects themselves is outside the scope of this feat.

You know how to take a fall.
Benefit: If you fall or jump you can reduce the damage taken by treating the fall as if it were 10' shorter. You
also gain a +5 bonus to skill checks to reduce falling damage. This effect stacks with similar benefits from

FEARSOME FORTITUDE [General]
You are exceedingly difficult to kill.
Prerequisite: Con 15, Toughness

points you are below 0. If successful you do not die, but are stabilized at -9 hit points. You remain
unconscious and appear dead to casual observation for ten minutes even if healed during that time. You can

each time you take this feat.

Benefit: Choose one weapon that you have Weapon Focus and Weapon Finesse for. When unencumbered,
in light armor or less, and wielding this type of weapon, you may make one extra attack per round. The
attack is at your highest base attack bonus, but each attack (the extra one and all the normal ones) suffer a -
2 penalty. You must use the full attack action. This feat does not stack with other feats/abilities that grant
extra attacks, such as Flurry of Blows, two weapon use, double weapons, or creatures that make multiple
attacks. It does stack with the iterative attacks of a character with high base attack bonus.
Notes: This is a fencing technique, and fits well in a renaissance-style game.

FOLLOW UP [General, Fighter]
You can push through enemy lines to create a breach.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: When using the Full Attack action, if you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically

in a round this feat may be used, although you may not move further than your current movement rate in one
round using this feat.

the same attack roll (with a –4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage normally (but see Special).
For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add one additional arrow to this
attack, to a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the second
adds a cumulative –2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total penalty of –6 for three arrows and –8 for four).
Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.
Special: Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you
score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage. A fighter
may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats. A 6th-level ranger who has chosen the archery
combat style is treated as having Manyshot even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when
he is wearing light or no armor.

MARTIAL WEAPON PROFICIENCY [General, Fighter]
Choose a type of martial weapon. You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat.
Benefit: You make attack rolls with the selected weapon normally.
Normal: When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
Special: Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all martial weapons. They need not
select this feat. You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it
applies to a new type of weapon. A cleric who chooses the War domain automatically gains the Martial
Weapon Proficiency feat related to his deity's favored weapon as a bonus feat, if the weapon is a martial
one. He need not select it.

MASTER ARTISAN [General]
You can make items faster using the Craft skill.
Prerequisite: Craft (of the specific type chosen with the feat) 8 ranks or higher
Benefit: Select a craft skill when you learn this feat. When working in a well-equipped workshop (5,000gp
value or better), with at least two assistants (who need not be skilled), you can produce craft goods of this
type at an increased rate. Calculate production in gold pieces per week, instead of the usual silver pieces per
week resulting in a crafting rate ten times faster than normal.
Special: This feat can be taken several times, but does not stack. Each time, it applies to a different variant
of the Craft skill.

MASTER BATTLECASTER [General]
You have mastered the ability to combine magic and war-skill on the battlefield.
Prerequisite: Combat Casting, Base attack bonus +6, Concentration 8 ranks, Ability to cast second level
spells
Benefit: During a full attack action, you may sacrifice a single attack of your highest attack bonus in order to
cast a spell with a casting time of one standard action or less. Casting a spell in combat in this manner is
difficult and requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to do successfully. Casting a spell while
threatened by an opponent still triggers an Attack of Opportunity, which may be avoided by casting
defensively.
Example: You have two attacks, one at +10 and a second at +5, you may sacrifice the +10 attack to cast a
spell in combat, and still make an attack at +5.

MASTERFUL SCROLL CASTING [Epic]
You can cast a spell from a scroll without causing the writing of the activated spell to disappear.
Prerequisite: Scribe Scroll, Spellcraft 15 ranks
Benefit: By spending a spell slot equal or higher in level to the spell activated from a scroll, you can cast the
spell from the scroll without causing the writing of the spell to disappear. A prepared spell or any unused
spell slot can be used to power the scroll, but the prepared spell or spell slot cannot be from your chosen
domain or specialty school. Casting a spell from a scroll in this manner requires a full-round action that
provokes attacks of opportunity. Otherwise, all standard rules for scroll casting apply (the scroll must first be
deciphered, it must be the correct type and appear or your class list, and you must have the prerequisite
ability score to cast spells of that level).

MEDDLESOME [General]
You are well trained in the art of disrupting spell casting.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +4
Benefit: Anyone you threaten suffers a -5 penalty on any attempt to cast defensively.

METALINGUIST [General]
You have an intuitive understanding of the basics of communication.
Benefit: If you do not share a language with another person/creature, you may, over the course of a minute,
convey an abstract thought, idea or question that you could otherwise express with a full round of speech. If
the other party also takes the time to communicate at the same pace, you can understand in return. Of
course, there is always some risk of mistranslation.
Special: You can only communicate with creatures that speak some language. A purely telepathic creature,
or one communicating through scents but not words, is unintelligible to you.
Notes: This feat incorporates the Pidgin feat from earlier versions of the Netbook of Feats.

METICULOUS [General]
You are talented at forgery and looting.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Forgery and Search checks.

MIGHTY CHARGE [General, Fighter]
You charge with single minded purpose and determination.

You are particularly skilled at hunting.
Prerequisite: Survival 4 ranks

the Survival skill to hunt and forage and while tracking (using the Track feat).
Special: This feat may be selected multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different terrain type.
Notes: This feat allows you to provide food and water for two more people when you make a Survival roll for
this purpose, since every two points that the Survival roll exceeds ten provides food for another person.
Assuming just the minimum skill ranks and a family size of five members or less, this feat is enough to allow
a single hunter to take care of the entire family on an average roll.

MIGHTY RAGE [Epic, Rage]
Your rages are especially powerful.
Prerequisite: Str 21, Con 21, Greater rage class feature, Rage 5/day
Benefit: When yourages, you gain a +8 bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +4 morale bonus on Will
saves. (These bonuses replace the normal rage bonuses.)

MIMICRY [General]
You can replicate almost any natural sound you have ever heard
Prerequisite: Perform (Comedy) 1 rank
Benefit: As a standard action, you can imitate almost any sound (footsteps, a door opening or closing, or two
people fighting). You cannot simulate anything louder than a shout or duplicate the sound of any magical
effect like a banshee's wail. Use the Perform (comedy) skill opposed by the audience's listen skill to be
convincing.
Special: You cannot make the sounds appear to come from somewhere else without additional abilities
beside this feat.

MIND OVER BODY [General]
Your ability damage heals more rapidly.
Prerequisite: Con 13

Special: You can take this feat multiple times.

MISSILE PROOF [General, Fighter]
You may block projectiles easily with your shield.
Prerequisite: Combat Reflexes, Shield Proficiency
Benefit: You must be using a Buckler, Small Shield or Large Shield when using this feat. Once per round
when you or someone immediately behind you would normally be hit with a ranged weapon, you may make
a Reflex saving throw against a DC of 20 (if the ranged weapon has a magical bonus to attack, the DC
increases by that amount). You add a Small or Large Shield's armor bonus, and enhancement bonus if
applicable, to your Reflex check for purposes of this feat. If you succeed, you deflect the weapon. You must
be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. You may block an incoming missile attack with your shield only
once per round. This feat also allows you to block magical projectile attacks (e.g. acid arrow, fire arrow), but
the shield will sustain any damage from the spell that exceeds its hardness. Against special attacks with
splash damage (e.g. acid, alchemist's fire, etc.), if the Reflex saving throw is successful, the shield takes the
primary damage and you take only the splash damage.
Special: You may take this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, you may
block an additional missile attack with your shield. You may not block more attacks in a round than 1 + your
Dexterity bonus (minimum of one attack).

MOUNTED COMBAT [General, Fighter]
You can steer your mount out of harms way.
Prerequisite: Ride 1 rank
Benefit: Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to
negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll.
(Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the mount's Armor Class if it's higher than the mount's regular
AC.)
Special: A fighter may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter bonus feats.

MOUNTED DODGE [General, Fighter]
You may avoid attacks to yourself or your mount.
Prerequisite: Wild Rider, Mounted Combat, Ride skill
Benefit: When mounted, you may use your Ride skill and Mounted Combat feat to evade attacks against
yourself or against your mount. Either use counts against the limitation on how often Mounted Combat can
be used.

MOUNTED OVERRUN [General, Fighter]
It becomes easier to make mounted overruns.
Prerequisite: Mounted Combat, Ride
Benefit: When using the Overrun combat maneuver while mounted, your mount can overrun any number of
opponents in your movement path so long as it moves in a straight path. In addition the mount move twice its
current movement rate while Overrunning by making the Overrun combat maneuver a full round action
instead of a standard action. If the mount fails a strength check at any point, the maneuver ends as normal.
Notes: This works very nicely with the Trample feat, making it possible to trample a series of opponents each
round.

NATURAL RIDER [General]
You have a natural understanding of animals and can coax the best out of them.
Prerequisite: Animal Handling 4 ranks, Ride 4 Ranks
Benefit: Any lightly loaded (non-magical) mount you ride receives a 10 foot bonus to its speed (all types –

the Withdraw action (that is taking only move actions in order to get away from you).
Normal: A withdrawing character does not provoke attacks of opportunity when leaving a threatened square
they started the turn in.
Notes: This feat does not allow Attacks of Opportunity against opponents who are tumbling or taking a 5'
step, only those using the Withdraw action.

Benefit: You get a +5 circumstance bonus on all Intimidate checks when dealing with someone who has

Normal: Ranged weapons normally can't make attacks of opportunity, and you have no threatened area
when using them.
Special: If you use Rapid Shot in the same round as you use Opportunity Shot, the -2 attack penalty applies
to Opportunity Shot as well.
Notes: You can't make an attack of opportunity against an opponent with 1/2 or more cover, such as behind

if the multiplier is x4, add +3d6 points of bonus damage instead. Creatures immune to critical hits can't be
affected by this feat.
Special: A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time a character takes
the feat, it applies to a different type of weapon.

PACK ATTACK [General, Fighter]
You are trained to coordinate with others to bring down powerful enemies

bonus.

PACK INITIATIVE [General, Fighter]
You can coordinate your initiative with pack mates.
Prerequisite: Pack Attack
Benefit: If you and an ally both have this feat, you may change your initiative order to act on the same

3 plus your Constitution modifier you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to both your Strength and to Intimidation

apposed to an uncontrolled frenzy, or even a sick dementia.

PALM STRIKE [General, Fighter]
You can push your opponents with unarmed stikes.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: Declare that you are using Palm Strike before you make your attack roll. If you successfully strike
your opponent with an unarmed strike, they must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + ½ your level + Wis modifier).

may attempt a Palm Strike once per day for every four levels you have attained and no more than once per

special material for the purposes of bypassing the damage reduction of any creature you strike. None of the
other special properties of special materials are gained by your melee weapons.

different special material. The character's melee attacks are treated as being crafted of all chosen materials

opponent's Armor Class provided by armor, shield or natural armor. Each use of Penetrating Ki Strike counts

failed attack roll ruins your attempt and wastes three stunning attacks. Penetrating Ki Strike is a supernatural
ability.

PERCEPTIVE DUELIST [General]

Benefit: You can make as many attacks with each extra weapon as with your primary weapon, using the
same base attack bonus. You still take the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons.
Normal: A creature without this feat can make only one attack per round with each extra weapon (or two
attacks per round with each weapon if it has Multiweapon Fighting, or three attacks per round with each
extra weapon if it has Greater Multiweapon Fighting). Each attack after the first extra attack has a cumulative

Prerequisite: Spellcraft 25 ranks, Ability to cast the spell to be made permanent
Benefit: Designate any one of your spells whose area is an emanation from your self. This spell's effect is

this feat. You add +1 to your attack roll if your opponent is wearing light armor, +2 if your opponent is
wearing medium armor, and +3 if your opponent is wearing heavy armor. Shields and natural armor are not
considered armor for the purposes of this feat.

PIN WEAPON [General, Fighter]
This feat allows you to 'lock blades' with an opponent, reducing their ability to react
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +3
Benefit: As a full-attack action, you can strike an opponent's weapon in order to pin it. This works like a
disarm but does not trigger an attack of opportunity. A successful pin causes both of you to be flat-footed as
long as it is maintained.
Special: You can only use Pin Weapon unarmed if you have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.
Example: Friar Tuck is rescuing some children from a castle dungeon when a guard blocks the way. Tuck
pins his weapon, shouting for the children to run past. The guard cannot make any attacks of opportunity,
being flat-footed.

PINPOINT SHOT [General, Fighter]
You take aim with ranged weapons more accurately when staying still.

POISON TOLERANCE [General]
You have worked up a tolerance to certain poisons
Prerequisite: Con 13, Poison Use, Craft (alchemy) 1 rank
Benefit: You are able to train your body to ignore the effects of certain (specific) poisons. You must have
access to the poison so you can gradually work up an immunity by subjecting yourself to increasingly larger
doses. It takes at least a full dose of the poison and one month's time (during which you can still do other
things) to work up the immunity. The immunity will fade in a month if you do not use another dose to keep it
up.

POISON USE [General]
You have learned how to use poisons effectively
Prerequisite: Craft (alchemy) 1 rank
Benefit: You can use poisons with no danger to yourself.
Notes: This feat only applies to the percentage chance that you may poison yourself while using poisons. It
does not provide immunity (see the Poison Tolerance feat for that added ability).

POLAR BEAR SKIN [General]
Your skin is better able to withstand the effects of extremely cold weather.
Benefit: You suffer no nonlethal cold damage from environmental conditions. In extreme cold (below -20° F)
you take 1d6 points of lethal damage per 10 minutes of exposure instead of every minute.
Special: This feat offers no protection against lethal cold damage from spells or spell like effects.

POLE FIGHTING [General, Fighter]
When fighting with a pole arm you can use the butt to strike opponents
Prerequisite: Str 13, Weapon Proficiency With A Pole Arm
Benefit: When using a pole arm in two hands, you can use the butt end to make an additional attack. The
butt end counts as a normal quarter staff. For pole-arms without reach, this allows you to use them as double
weapons. That is, you can fight as if using two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal penalties
associated with fighting with two weapons, as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.
For pole arms with reach, it means you can use the butt, without reach, and thus strike adjacent opponents.
You are effectively using your butt end in two hands and get the improved damage bonus from strength that
this allows.
Special: Pole arms include the halfspear, shortspear, trident, glaive, guisarme, halberd, longspear, ranseur
and quarterstaff. The merits of this feat are intrinsic to the quarterstaff.

POLE VAULTING [General]
You can use a pole or pole weapon to enhance your jumps.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Dex 13
Benefit: When you jump while holding a pole or pole weapon you can add a +10 bonus to your jump check.
A flexible pole can be used to enhance height, and a stiff pole can enhance horizontal distance. The pole
must be approximately as long as you are tall but could be longer.
Notes: Modern vaulting poles are quite different from a simple bamboo pole or oak quarterstaff. They bend
converting forward motion into upward motion. The approximate maximum height a human pole-vaulter can
achieve is about 20' (this would translate into a huge jump skill bonus). A stiff pole is only useful for getting
your feet higher off the ground or extending a horizontal jump.

POLYGLOT [Epic]
You can speak, read, and write any language under the sun.
Prerequisite: Int 25, Speak Language (five languages)
Benefit: You can speak all languages. If you are literate, you can also read and write all languages (not
including magical script).

journeys.

POWER ATTACK [General, Fighter]
You sacrifice accuracy for power.
Prerequisite: Str 13
Benefit: On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from all
melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your
base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn.
Special: If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands,
instead add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can't add the bonus from Power Attack
to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even
though the penalty on attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a one-handed
weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with
only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.) A fighter may select Power Attack as one
of his fighter bonus feats.

POWER CLIMBER [General]
You can climb using only one hand.
Prerequisite: Str 15, Dex 13, Climb 8 ranks
Benefit: You can climb using one less limb than you would normally use without additional penalty. Thus a
typical humanoid could climb using two feet and one hand for instance. This generally allows you to use a
shield or wield a weapon while climbing. Should you choose to use all your available limbs you gain a +2
bonus to your climb checks.

POWER CRITICAL [General, Fighter]
You are more likely to confirm a critical hit.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus (chosen Weapon), Base attack bonus +4
Benefit: When using the weapon you selected, you gain a +4 bonus on the roll to confirm a threat.
Special: A fighter may select Power Critical as one of his fighter bonus feats. You can gain Power Critical
multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it may be with a different weapon or the same weapon. If you
take it with the same weapon, the effects of the feats stack.

POWER DOUBLE WEAPON [General, Fighter]
You have learned to maximize the strength of your blows when wielding a double weapon.
Prerequisite: Two-weapon Fighting, Power Attack, Base attack bonus +3
Benefit: When wielding a double weapon, you add your full Strength bonus to damage rolls with all of your
primary and secondary attacks.
Normal: Without this feat you add your full Strength bonus to damage rolls with your primary attack(s) and
half your Strength bonus to damage rolls with your secondary attack(s).

POWER RESTING [General]
You need a smaller amount of rest than usual to stay active and alert
Benefit: You only need half the usual amount of sleep to awaken fully refreshed and recovered from fatigue
penalties, healed and ready to relearn arcane spells and/or regain power points. This feat does not allow you
to gain any more spells or power points per day than normal.
Normal: Without this feat you require 8 hours of sleep to awaken refreshed.
Special: An elf with this feat needs four hours of trance to prepare spells, but needs no rest besides that in
order to recover from fatigue.
Notes: This incorporates the Night Owl and Power Resting feats from previous versions of the netbook.

POWERFUL VOICE [General]
You can project your voice so that you may be heard at great distances.
Benefit: When projecting your voice, all opposed Listen rolls are made with a +10 circumstance bonus.
Notes: This duplicates the effect of being heard as well from 100' as a normal person is from 0', and is
intended to be applicable in any situation where a Listen roll is appropriate, such as yelling to others in battle,
a bardic effect upon those that can hear it, etc.

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT [General]
You are better at skills when you take your time.
Benefit: When taking a 10 or 20 on a skill check, you get a +3 competence bonus to your skill check.

PRECISE SHOT [General, Fighter]
You can shoot at opponents in melee without penalty.
Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot
Benefit: You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the
standard –4 penalty on your attack roll.
Special: A fighter may select Precise Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.

PRONE COMBAT [General]
You are able to fight from a prone position without penalty.
Benefit: You suffer no attack or AC penalties for being prone.
Normal: When prone you suffer a -4 to attack and AC against melee opponents.

PULL BLOW [General, Fighter]
You can choose to leave your victims alive when they might otherwise die
Prerequisite: Int 13, Combat Expertise, Weapon Focus, Heal 1 rank, Base attack bonus +3
Benefit: When attacking with a weapon for which you have weapon focus, if you injure an opponent enough
to take them below zero hit points you may pull your blow, dealing exactly enough damage to take them to -1
hit point. Furthermore, although unconscious their condition automatically becomes stable (not taking
bleeding damage), rather than dying.
Special: You cannot use this feat on a critical hit. This feat has no effect on creatures such as undead and
constructs that are destroyed upon reaching 0 hit points.
Notes: Imagine a master swordsman that cuts with such precision that they can wound exactly the amount
they wish to by cutting "just so". The benefit of this feat over doing nonlethal damage is that you can make
your decision after the fact and that creatures immune to nonlethal damage can effectively be subdued.

QUICK DRAW [General, Fighter]
You can draw a weapon as a free action.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1
Benefit: You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden
weapon (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move action. A character who has selected this feat may throw
weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).
Normal: Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or
higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard
action.
Special: A fighter may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter bonus feats.

QUICK GRAB [General]
You can pick things up with minimal movement and effort.
Prerequisite: Dex 13
Benefit: As a swift action you may pick up any weapon (of a size you could wield) or similar sized unsecured
item on the ground or within 5' without provoking an attack of opportunity. You must have a free hand to hold
the item in.

QUICK SCENT [Racial]
Your racial scent abilities work more quickly than others of your race.
Prerequisite: Wis 15, Racial scent ability
Benefit: You may take a swift action to note the direction of a scent.
Normal: Creatures with the scent ability must take a move action to note the direction of a scent.
Notes: You may only take one swift action a round.

QUICK STUDY [Stealth]
You can quickly sense your opponent's weakness.
Prerequisite: Death Attack class ability, Sneak attack +6d6
Benefit: You may perform a death attack after studying a potential victim for two rounds.
Normal: You need to study an opponent three rounds before a death attack.

QUICK SWAP [General, Fighter]
You can confuse your opponent by swapping your weapon between hands.
Prerequisite: Improved Feint, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: In melee while using a light or 1-handed weapon in one hand with nothing in your other, you may
switch your weapon to your other hand as a free action. As part of this free action, you may make a feint
(see Bluff Skill description). You may only make this feint once per round.

QUICKSILVER [General, Fighter]
You are truly adept at dodging blows and avoiding damage in combat.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Dodge, Base attack bonus +3
Benefit: Increase the dodge bonus provided to your Armor Class by your Dodge feat to +2. This supercedes
(does not stack with) the Dodge feat. You can also apply this +2 bonus as a dodge bonus to Reflex saves
against your chosen opponent. Any condition that makes you lose your dexterity bonus to Armor Class also
makes you lose any dodge bonuses to your Armor Class or Reflex saves.
Special: This feat stacks with the Improved Dodge feat (also in this netbook), allowing you to apply the +2
dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves granted by the Quicksilver feat against all opponents.

RANGED COMBAT EXPERTISE [General, Fighter]
You can use Combat Expertise with a ranged weapon.
Prerequisite: Int 13, Combat Expertise
Benefit: You may gain the benefits of the Combat Expertise feat while using a ranged weapon.
Normal: Combat Expertise can only be used with melee weapons.

RANGED SHIELD PIN [General, Fighter]
You have mastered the art of striking an opponent's shield to knock it out of line, rendering it useless for
defense.
Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Base attack bonus +2
Benefit: When using a proficient ranged weapon to attack an opponent within 30 feet, you may choose to
deal no damage with a successful hit. Instead, you negate any benefits your target gains from their shield
until their next action. You can attempt this once per round against any shield-wielding opponent who is
within one size category of you. You must announce before you attack that you are making a Ranged Shield
Pin.
Notes: This feat is only useful if you have multiple attacks and your opponent's shield gives them at least a
+6 armor bonus, or alternatively if you have allies that can attack the same opponent before they can re-
adjust their shield.

RANK FIGHTING [General, Fighter]
You are trained to strike past friends using reach weapons
Prerequisite: Weapon Proficiency With A Reach Weapon
Benefit: You can ignore the cover provided by a friend in-between you and your opponent when striking with
a reach weapon. You make such attacks with no penalty.
Normal: A friend in the way of a reach weapon attack provides cover, giving a +4 bonus to the target's AC.

RAPID METABOLISM [General]
Your wounds heal rapidly.
Prerequisite: Con 13
Benefit: You naturally heal a number of hit points per day equal to the standard healing rate + double your
Constitution bonus. You heal even if you do not rest. This healing replaces your normal natural healing. If
you are tended successfully by someone with the Heal skill, you instead regain double the normal amount of
hit points + double your Constitution bonus.

RAPID RELOAD [General, Fighter]
Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy).
Prerequisite: Weapon Proficiency (crossbow Type Chosen)
Benefit: The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a
hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an
attack of opportunity. If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that
weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
Normal: A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round
action to reload a heavy crossbow.
Special: You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of
crossbow. A fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus feats.

RAPID SHOT [General, Fighter]
You can make an additional ranged attack.
Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot, Dex 13
Benefit: You can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest base
attack bonus, but each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a –2
penalty. You must use the full attack action to use this feat.
Special: A fighter may select Rapid Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats. A 2nd-level ranger who has
chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Rapid Shot, even if he does not have the prerequisites
for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.

RAPID THRUST [General, Fighter]
When wielding a light weapon you can make a series of rapid thrusts.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Weapon Finesse, Base attack bonus +4
Benefit: When making a full attack with a weapon that you can apply Weapon Finesse to, you may make a
single additional attack each round at your highest base attack bonus. However, you suffer a -2 penalty to all
your attacks until your next action and lose any Strength bonus to damage you might normally have gained.
Example: Myllard the 6th level ranger (Str 12, Dex 17) jumps inside the ogre's greatsword swing, dagger in
hand. Instead of two attacks with his dagger (base attack bonus +6/+1), he opts to make a series of rapid
thrusts. He attacks three times with a base attack bonuses of +4/+4/-1. He still receives his +3 bonus to hit
from his Weapon Finesse feat, but loses his +1 Strength damage bonus.

RAT HACKER [General, Fighter]
You are skilled at fighting creatures smaller than yourself.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +4
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus to Attack and AC against creatures smaller than yourself.


RECKLESS OFFENSE [General]
You can shift your focus from defense to offense.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1
Benefit: When you use the attack action or full attack action in melee, you can take a penalty of –4 to your
Armor Class and add a +2 bonus on your melee attack roll. The bonus on attack rolls and penalty to Armor
Class last until the beginning of your next turn.

REDEDICATION [Special]
You've wandered away from your true vocation long enough, now its time to return.
Benefit: Pick one class that has a multiclassing restriction (paladin or monk). You may now multiclass freely
with this class.
Notes: All other requirements, such as alignment, ability, skills, feats etc must still be met.

REFLECT ARROWS [Epic, Fighter]
You can deflect arrows back at whomever shot them.
Prerequisite: Dex 25, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike
Benefit: When you deflect an arrow or other ranged attack, the attack is reflected back upon the attacker at
your base ranged attack bonus.

REFLEX SET [General, Fighter]
You have honed your reflexes to the point where it is second nature for you to set your weapon against a
charging enemy
Prerequisite: Combat Reflexes
Benefit: When you are charged while holding a weapon that can be set against a charge, you get to make an
attack of opportunity before the charge attack is made, and you get the double damage normally associated
with setting such a weapon against a charge on this attack of opportunity. Weapons capable of being set
against a charge are noted in their individual descriptions in the SRD, and include the dwarven urgrosh,
halberd, longspear, spear and trident.

REPEATING CROSSBOW MASTERY [General, Fighter]
You are an expert at handling a Repeating Crossbow.
Prerequisite: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (repeating Crossbow)
Benefit: You can reload a repeating crossbow magazine as a move equivalent action that does not provoke
an attack of opportunity. You can cock a repeating crossbow without needing free hand to do so.
Normal: Reloading a Repeating Crossbow is a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity and
you must have a free hand to cock the crossbow between shots.

RESIST RESTRAINT [General]
You are difficult to restrain by any means.
Benefit: You receive a +4 bonus to all saves against any effect that would render you paralyzed, entangled,
or stunned. You also get a +4 bonus when making a defensive Grapple check (that is a grapple check in
which you are trying to escape or avoid being grappled).

RESUSCITATION [General]
Your understanding of medicine is so great that you can resuscitate fallen comrades.
Prerequisite: Skill Focus (heal), Heal 12 ranks
Benefit: You can restore a target creature to life that has fallen to -10 hp or below. This requires a full round
action which provokes an attack of opportunity. The attempt must be made within 10 rounds of the victim
falling below -10 hit points. You must make a Heal check and the target must make a Fortitude saving throw;
both with a DC equal to the number of hp the target has fallen below 0 (so a character at -16 hp has a DC
16). If you are both successful, the target is revived and stabilized at -9 hp but permanently loses one level
(or 1 Hit Dice), or if the target is level 1 it loses 2 Constitution. This loss can not be restored or repaired by
any means. If either roll fails, you cannot try resuscitating this target until they are brought back to life by
some other means.
Special: This can only be used on a victim that has died from loss of hit points and only if the body could
conceivable sustain life.
Notes: Unlike Raise Dead this spell does not cure disease, poison, stat damage or any effect other than hit
point loss.

REVERSE STRIKE [General, Fighter]
Your mastery of the double-weapon allows you to strike out at opponents just when they thought they had
you at a disadvantage.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6, Two-weapon Fighting, Dex 15
Benefit: When wielding a double weapon you can make an Attack of Opportunity with the off-hand part of the
double weapon against any foe who strikes at you from a "flanking" position.
Special: You get no attack of opportunity against opponents who receive flanking bonuses without being in
the regular flanking position because they have some special ability.
Notes: This feat works even if the foe would not receive any flanking bonuses for some reason - such as if
you have uncanny dodge.

RIDE-BY ATTACK [General, Fighter]
You can ride past a target you are charging.
Prerequisite: Mounted Combat, Ride 1 rank
Benefit: When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard
charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round
can't exceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of opportunity from
the opponent that you attack.
Special: A fighter may select Ride-By Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Notes: When using ride by attack, your movement path for the charge should be such that you pass within
striking range of your target, not such that you are charging directly at your target (as with a normal charge).
This is because you can not move through a space occupied by an enemy and thus if you were to charge
them in the normal manner you would not be able to continue your movement as the feat indicates is
possible.

RIGHTEOUS STRIKE [Epic, Special]
Your fists are charged with the power of law.
Prerequisite: Wis 19, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, Any lawful alignment
Benefit: Your unarmed strike is treated as an axiomatic weapon (it is lawfully aligned and deals an extra 2d6
points of damage against creatures of chaotic alignment). This ability doesn't stack with similar abilities.

RIPOSTE [General, Fighter]
After deflecting your opponent's blow, you quickly attack while they are over extended.
Prerequisite: Combat Expertise, Weapon Finesse, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: When unencumbered, in light armor or less, and using a weapon with Weapon Finesse, you may
make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who tries to attack you in melee and misses.
Special: This feat cannot be used if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC. You cannot use other feats
that allow extra attacks (such as Cleave) with a riposte.
Notes: This is a fencing technique, and fits well in a renaissance-style game.

ROBUST HEALTH [General, Fighter]
Your robust health makes you tougher than normal.
Prerequisite: Endurance
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus to your Constitution for the purposes of determining hit points only.
Special: Any creature that does not have a Constitution score, such as undead, may not take this feat. This
feat grants virtual access to the Toughness feat, allowing you to take other feats for which Toughness is a
prerequisite.


ROPE CLIMBER [General]
You are as comfortable climbing ropes and rigging as you are walking on the ground.
Prerequisite: Dex 13
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on all Balance and Climb skill checks so long as ropes and rigging are
involved. Thus, making your way up to a crow's nest would qualify for the bonus, but climbing a sheer rock
cliff would not. In addition, if you are attacked while climbing a rope or rigging, you may choose to negate
either the attacker's +2 bonus or the loss of your Dexterity bonus to AC, but not both).

RUINOUS RAGE [Epic, Rage]
You are good a breaking things when in a rage.
Prerequisite: Str 25, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Rage 5/day
Benefit: While in a rage, you ignore the hardness of any object you strike. Also, double your Strength bonus

normal damage (including bursting bindings, such as ropes or manacles).

RUN [General]
You can run very quickly.
Benefit: When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and
carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy
load). If you make a jump after a running start (see the Jump skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your
Jump check. While running, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC.
Normal: You move four times your speed while running (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying
no more than a medium load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load),
and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.

RUNNING ATTACK [General, Fighter]
You are especially fast and maneuverable on the battlefield.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Run, Base attack bonus +2
Benefit: As a full round action you may move twice your current speed and then make a single melee attack
with a -2 penalty to hit.

SAGE [General]
You have a better ability to remember information.
Prerequisite: 5 ranks in any 2 Knowledge skills
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus to all Knowledge skills

SAVAGE CRITICAL [General, Fighter]
Your critical hits are more powerful.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Power Attack, Base attack bonus +5, Weapon Focus
Benefit: The critical damage multiplier for the selected weapon is increased by one.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies
to a new type of weapon.
Notes: This feat is more powerful for low multiplier, large crit range weapons.

SELF-CONCEALMENT [Epic, Stealth]
You can partly conceal your location at all times.
Prerequisite: Dex 30, Hide 30 ranks, Tumble 30 ranks, Improved evasion
Benefit: Attacks against you have a 10% miss chance, similar to the effect of concealment. You loses this
benefit whenever you would lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.

maximum of 50% after it has been taken five times.

SENSE MAGIC [General]
You have a highly developed sensitivity to magic
Prerequisite: Spellcraft 1 rank
Benefit: You can sense whether an object you are handling or a creature you are touching is magical or
under the effects of a spell - the very air might be magical in some places. As a full-round action, you can tell
whether an item is magical with a Spellcraft check (DC 20). A success informs you if there is magic present;
a failure indicates that it is not.
Special: You cannot retry, take 10, or take 20 when using this feat.

SHARP-SHOOTING [General, Fighter]
You can minimize the effects of an opponents cover.
Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Base attack bonus +3
Benefit: Your targets only receive a +2 bonus to Armor class due to cover. This feat has no effect against
foes with no cover or total cover.
Normal: Cover normally gives a +4 bonus to AC.
Special: A fighter may select Sharp-Shooting as one of his bonus feats.

SHATTERING STRIKE [Epic, Special]
You can break things using sudden force.
Prerequisite: Epic Weapon Focus (unarmed Strike), Weapon Focus (unarmed Strike), Concentration 25
ranks, Ki strike (adamantine)
Benefit: When using an unarmed strike to attempt to break an object with sudden force (rather than by
dealing normal damage), make a Concentration check rather than a Strength check. The break DC remains
the same. Using Shattering Strike is a full-round action that incurs attacks of opportunity. You can't use
Shattering Strike to escape bonds (unless you are so bound as to allow you to make an unarmed strike
against your bindings).


SHOT ON THE RUN [General, Fighter]
You can shoot while moving.

make a successful attack against you, you gain an immediate attack of opportunity. This feat does not grant

denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, you do not gain the benefit of this feat.

You are proficient in simple weapons.
Benefit: You make attack rolls with simple weapons normally.
Normal: When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls.

weapons. They need not select this feat.

SKILL FOCUS [General]
Choose a skill.

to a new skill.

Prerequisite: Skill Focus And 5 Ranks In The Focused Skill
Benefit: You gain an additional +3 bonus on all checks involving this skill
Special: This feat can be taken several times, but does not stack with itself. Each time it is taken, it must be
applied to a separate skill.

Netbook of Feats.

SKILLED MULTICLASS [General]
You treat the class skills of all of your classes as class skills when you gain a new level.
Prerequisite: Multiclassed character
Benefit: Regardless of which class you advance when you gain a new level, you can treat the class skills of
all of your classes as class skills when buying new skills.

is restricted to sleeping/unconscious targets (e.g.: Nightmare), the bonus increases to +10.

You may bash a single opponent into submission.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus (any One Smashing Weapon)
Benefit: You can only get the benefit of this feat with a smash weapon you have Weapon Focus in. Make
one extra attack per round at your highest base attack. This requires the full attack action, and all your
attacks for the round must use smash weapons and be directed at the same opponent – you may not attack
anyone else for the remainder of the round. This includes attacks of opportunity.

You have trained in the use of a two-handed spear and shield together
Prerequisite: Shield Proficiency
Benefit: You can use spear or longspear together with a shield of any size (including a tower shield if you
have Tower Shield Proficiency), despite the fact that these are two-handed weapons.
Notes: This feat is right at home in ancient Greece, where hypaspists used it. The shield is slung over the
shoulder and maneuvered with the offhand that simultaneously holds the spear.

SPEED READER [General]
You are capable of reading the written word very quickly.
Prerequisite: Decipher Script 4 ranks, Int 13
Benefit: You are able to read a single page of written material as a full round action.

SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE [General, Fighter]
You exact vengeance from your enemies in blood
Benefit: Whenever an opponent wounds you in combat (deals damage to you), your next melee attack
against that foe gets a +1 morale bonus to hit and damage. Once you receive this bonus to an attack, the foe
must wound you again for you to gain the bonus again. If a foe wounds you multiple times before you attack
them, you only gain the bonus once, and to a single attack.

STAND STILL [General, Fighter]
You can prevent foes from fleeing or closing.
Prerequisite: Str 13
Benefit: When a foe's movement out of a square you threaten grants you an attack of opportunity, you can
give up that attack and instead attempt to stop your foe in his tracks. Make your attack of opportunity
normally. If you hit your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage roll (the
opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he had used up his move actions for the
round. Since you use the Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only a number
of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could make an attack of opportunity (normally
just one).
Normal: Attacks of opportunity cannot halt your foes in their tracks.

STAND YOUR GROUND [General, Fighter]
You keep fighting no matter how scared you get.
Prerequisite: Iron Will, Base attack bonus +4, Base Will save +2
Benefit: Whenever you would be cowering, frightened or panicked, you are shaken instead.
STAY DOWN [General, Fighter]
You can keep an opponent off their feet.

Benefit: When an opponent you threaten rises from being prone (provoking an attack of opportunity from
you), you can make a trip attack as normal (as your attack of opportunity) against that opponent. If you
succeed, the opponent remains prone and you may take your bonus attack from Improved Trip if you wish.
Normal: Your opponent can spend a move action (that provokes an attack of opportunity) to stand. Your
attack of opportunity cannot be a trip attack as it happens before he finishes standing and you cannot trip a
prone opponent.

STEALTHY [General]
You are a very sneaky person.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Hide checks and Move Silently checks.

STIPEND [Trait]
You come from a wealthy background.
Benefit: When you select this feat at character creation, roll 2d10 and multiply by 10. When you get your

number. This money must be picked up someplace; at your estates, a bank, from an academy, from a
patron, or whatever. It will accumulate if not collected.
Special: This feat is only available at character creation.

STONE THROWER [General, Fighter]
Just as monks can slay with their fists your skill turns a common stone into a dangerous missile.
Benefit: You treat normal stones between 1 and 5 pounds as a simple ranged weapon. A typical stone deals
1d6 damage, has a threat range of 20/x2, and a range increment of 20 feet. A poor stone has the same stats
but deals only 1d4 damage. You may find a typical stone in some outdoor environments (DM's discretion) as
a full round action, or a poor stone as a move equivalent action. You may take all the usual weapon feats
using stone as a weapon of choice.
Normal: A stone is considered an improvised weapon and deals small amounts of nonlethal damage.

STORM OF THROWS [Epic, Fighter]
You can throw many weapons in one round.
Prerequisite: Dex 23, Point Blank Shot, Quick Draw, Rapid Shot

Benefit: Once per round, if you make a successful melee attack with an unarmed strike or a light weapon,
you deal an extra 1d4 points of nonlethal damage.

STRIKE AT THE TAIL [General, Fighter]
You have learned superior disarming techniques.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6, Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Disarm
Benefit: If you successfully disarm an opponent in melee combat, you immediately get a melee attack
against that opponent as if you hadn't used your attack for the disarm attempt. If you succeed you may
choose to catch your opponent's weapon in your off-hand if free. You may only gain one free attack per
round using this technique.

STRIKE FAVORED ENEMY [Special]

STUNNING FIST [General, Fighter]
You can stun an opponent with your attack.
Prerequisite: Improved Unarmed Strike, Base attack bonus +8, Dex 13, Wis 13
Benefit: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack
roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude
saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally.
A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action). A stunned
character can't act, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a –2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a
stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than
once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical
hits cannot be stunned.
Special: A monk may select Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the
prerequisites. A monk who selects this feat may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per day equal
to her monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels she has in classes other than monk. A
fighter may select Stunning Fist as one of his fighter bonus feats.

SUDDEN ACTION [General]
You can take quick and decisive action at the start of combat.
Prerequisite: Combat Reflexes, Improved Initiative, Mobility, Quick Draw
Benefit: During a surprise round you may act as if it were a normal combat round. So, instead of taking a
single move or standard action you may perform a full round action, full attack, two move actions, or a move
action and a standard action.
Normal: You may only take a standard action or move action during a surprise round.


SUPERIOR FEINT [General, Fighter]
You can fake out your opponents with incredible speed.
Prerequisite: Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Feint, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: You can make a Bluff check to feint in combat as a swift action.
Notes: A swift action is a free action that can only be performed once per round.

SUPERIOR INITIATIVE [Epic]
You are an expert at getting the jump on your opponents.
Prerequisite: Improved Initiative
Benefit: You get a +8 bonus on initiative checks. This bonus overlaps (does not stack with) the bonus from
Improved Initiative.

SUPERIOR TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING [General, Fighter]
You can remove the penalty for using a one handed weapon in your off hand.
Prerequisite: Str 15, Dex 15, Two-weapon Fighting, Base attack bonus +3
Benefit: You can use any one-handed weapon in your off hand as if it were a light weapon.

SWARM OF ARROWS [Epic, Fighter]
You can shower your foes with arrows.
Prerequisite: Dex 23, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, Weapon Focus (type Of Bow Used)
Benefit: As a full-round action, you may fire an arrow at your full base attack bonus at each opponent within
30 feet.

TALENTED HEALER [General]
You can provide first aid and treat wounds or poison more quickly in combat.
Prerequisite: Heal 4 ranks, Wis 13
Benefit: You can provide first aid, treat wounds or treat poison as a move action.
Normal: Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action.

TAUNT [General]
You are adept at angering your opponents and provoking them to attack you.
Benefit: As a standard action you may target a specific opponent who can clearly see and hear you within
60'. This only works against intelligent creatures and is an extraordinary, mind-affecting, compulsion effect.
Make an opposed Intimidation check against the target's modified level check (1d20 + Hit Dice + target's
Wisdom bonus). If the target does not understand the language you are speaking your intimidation check
suffers a -5 penalty. If successful the target is compelled to direct any attacks or offensive spells/powers it
makes at you until one of you is defeated or until the target is attacked by another opponent. If you move out
of sight or if it is impossible for your opponent to attack you they are free from the compulsion.
Special: This is a variant of the Demoralize Opponent use of the Intimidation skill; any feat or ability that
alters the use of Intimidation to demoralize an opponent in combat also effects this feat.

TEAM FIGHTING [General, Fighter]
You know how to fight as a pair, group, and in formation.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1
Benefit: Two or more people can fight together as a team. The team members block and parry blows for
each other. Team members also work together to open up opponent's weaknesses. Team members need to
be within each other's threatened area and every team member needs to have the feat. Each person having
Team Fighting gets a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Also, if two people
have Team Fighting they can switch carried items as a free action. This would allow one person to reload a
Heavy Crossbow or Repeating Crossbow while the other fires, thus one character could fire the Heavy
Crossbow every round while the other person is loading.
Notes: This feat can be used to model the extra effectiveness of Swiss pike men, Monks fighting together, or
Athenian bonded battle partners.

TERRIFYING RAGE [Rage]
Your rage is terrifying to behold and fearsome to your enemies
Prerequisite: Rage 2/day, Base attack bonus +3
Benefit: When enraged, all opponents within 10 feet with HD less than your own must make a Will save (DC
= 10 + 1/2 Rage-associated class levels + Cha bonus) or become shaken (-2 morale penalty on all attack
rolls, checks and saving throws) for the duration of your rage. This is an extraordinary ability that only works
when you are using your Rage class ability. Its effects also end if you are subdued, restrained, rendered
unconscious or slain, or if your opponent moves more than 10 feet away from you. Opponents that succeed
in their saving throws are immune to the terrifying effect of your rage for one day.

THREATENED REACH [General, Fighter]
Your mobility and footwork make you a deadly opponent in combat.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: Designate one opponent on your turn as a free action. Against this opponent, your weapon's threat
range is increased by 5 feet, as long as you maintain a direct, unimpeded line of sight to your chosen
opponent. If this opponent provokes an attack of opportunity within this expanded range, you may take an
immediate attack of opportunity against them. You are free to change opponents each round. You may only
use this feat when unarmored or in medium or lighter armor.
Normal: Your threat range is normally 5 feet unless larger than Medium size or armed with a reach weapon.

THROW AND CHARGE [General, Fighter]
You can hurl a thrown weapon while charging.
Prerequisite: Quick Draw, Run, Base attack bonus +1
Benefit: As a full round action, you can throw a light or one-handed missile weapon, draw another weapon,
and then charge. Both attacks are made at your highest base attack bonus, with a +2 bonus to your charge
attack. You cannot use this feat in heavy armor or if carrying a heavy load.

TORNADO ATTACK [General, Fighter]
You can combine your whirlwind attack with a 5-foot step, moving and striking in a whirlwind of deadly blows.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, Base
attack bonus +12
Benefit: You can take a 5-foot step while making your Whirlwind Attack, allowing you to attack all opponents
within range before and after your 5-foot movement. This requires a full-attack action, you can only strike at
an individual opponent within range once and you are still limited to one 5-foot step per round. All restrictions
and benefits to your 5-foot movement apply normally.
Special: If you have the Whirlwind Attack feat this can substitute for the Combat Expertise and Whirlwind
Attack prerequisites

TOSS [General, Fighter]
You may throw an opponent when grappling.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: When grappling an opponent and you win an opposed grapple check on your action, you may throw
your opponent instead of the usual options. For every 5 points you exceed your opponents grapple check by,
you may toss your opponent 5 feet. You may also add 5 feet for each size category you are larger than the
opponent. If you succeed by less than 5 you still toss your opponent 5 feet. In this case they have still "fallen"
but won't take damage from the fall.
Special: The victim is considered to have fallen a distance equal to the distance they were thrown. This
typically results in falling prone and taking 1d6 points of damage per 10' fallen. A victim striking a wall or
other obstacle will take damage as if they were thrown the full distance. You must be strong enough to lift the
victim over your head (their weight cannot exceed your maximum load).
Notes: Size is already figured into the grappling roll, but I felt that it didn't give a realistically large boost to
the distance thrown so distance was added without affecting the grapple check.

TOUCH MASTERY [General, Fighter]
The attribute behind your powers makes your touch attacks strike true.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1
Benefit: When making a touch attack with a spell or psionic power, you use your associated
spellcasting/psionic attribute bonus rather than your Strength or Dexterity bonus on your attack roll.

TOUCH OF GRACE [General]
Fate is looking out for you.
Prerequisite: Cha 15
Benefit: You get a +1 bonus on all saving throws.
Special: This feat can be taken several times, but only once at any level, and the benefits stack. For each
time after the first, increase the Charisma prerequisite by 2.

TOUGHNESS [General]
You are tougher than average.
Benefit: You gain +3 hit points.
Special: A character may gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.

TRACK [General]
You can use the survival skill to track enemies.
Benefit: To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make
another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.
You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check, or at up to
twice your normal speed with a -20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing
conditions, as given on the table below:
Surface
Survival DC

Surface
Survival DC
Very soft ground
5

Firm ground
15
Soft ground
10

Hard ground
20

Very Soft Ground: Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of
footprints.
Soft Ground: Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a
creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.
Firm Ground: Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft
or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces
(broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.
Hard Ground: Any surface that doesn't hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most
streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The
creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).
Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the table below:
Condition
Survival DC Modifier
Every three creatures in the group being tracked
-1
Size of creature or creatures being tracked: 1
Fine
+8
Diminutive
+4
Tiny
+2
Small
+1
Medium-sized
0
Large
-1
Huge
-2
Gargantuan
-4
Colossal
-8
Every 24 hours since the trail was made
+1
Every hour of rain since the trail was made
+1
Fresh snow cover since the trail was made
+10
Poor visibility: 2
Overcast or moonless night
+6
Moonlight
+3
Fog or precipitation
+3
Tracked party hides trail (and moves at half speed)
+5

1. For a group of mixed sizes, apply only the modifier for the largest size category.
2. Apply only the largest modifier from this category.

If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.

Normal: Without this feat, you can use the Survival skill to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC
for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the Search skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a
creature's passage using the DCs given above, but you can't use Search to follow tracks, even if someone
else has already found them.
Special: A ranger automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He need not select it. This feat does not allow
you to find or follow the tracks made by a subject of a pass without trace spell.

TRAMPLE [General, Fighter]
You can run down foes when overrunning on a mount.
Prerequisite: Mounted Combat, Ride 1 rank
Benefit: When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you.
Your mount may make one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining the standard +4 bonus
on attack rolls against prone targets.
Special: A fighter may select Trample as one of his fighter bonus feats.

TRAP SENSE [Epic, Stealth]
You have a second sense for traps.
Prerequisite: Search 25 ranks, Spot 25 ranks, Trapfinding class ability
Benefit: If you passes within 5 feet of a trap, you is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if you were
actively looking for it.

TUMBLING ATTACK [General, Fighter]
Execute a startling series of attacks while you tumble through your enemy's midst.
Prerequisite: Dex 15, Int 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Skill Focus (tumble), Spring Attack, Tumble
1 rank, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: As a full attack action, you are able to tumble at one-half speed, and if you succeed at your tumble
check (see Tumble skill, SRD), you suffer no attacks of opportunity and may make your full number of
attacks while you tumble. However, you are able to attack no more than once from any single five foot
square through which you move (including the squares in which you start and finish the tumble). Even with
this feat, the move is so difficult to execute that it adds +2 to the DC of your tumble check and all attacks
suffer -2 penalty to hit. If you fail your tumble check, you suffer attacks of opportunity normally and can make
only a single attack.
Normal: You tumble as a move action and can make a single attack as a standard action.
Special: This feat cannot be used with ranged attacks or reach weapons. If you are using two weapons or a
double weapon, you still may only attack once from each square, so that the maximum number of attacks
you can execute is 5.

TWIN WEAPON FIGHTING [General, Fighter]
You can wield a matching pair of weapons, one in each hand, with extraordinary ability.
Prerequisite: Two-weapon Fighting, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: Choose a one-handed weapon, based on your size. When wielding one of the chosen weapons in
each hand, you suffer only a -2 attack penalty with both weapons.
Normal: With the Two-Weapon Fighting feat and a one-handed weapon, you get a -4 penalty on attacks with
both weapons.

TWO HANDED POWER STRIKE [General, Fighter]
You use your weight and momentum to maximum effect.
Prerequisite: Str 15, Power Attack, Base attack bonus +9
Benefit: You may add twice your Strength bonus to damage when using a two-handed melee weapon
instead of the usual one and a half times Strength bonus.

TWO-HANDED FLURRY [General, Fighter]
You are adept at wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Dex 15, Combat Expertise, Weapon Focus, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: Select a one-handed weapon that you have previously chosen Weapon Focus for. When wielding
this weapon with two hands, you may make one extra attack at your highest base attack bonus. If this extra
attack is taken, you suffer a -2 penalty to all of your attack rolls and can only add your normal Strength bonus
to damage rolls (rather than 1.5 times your Strength bonus for using a weapon with two hands) until your
next action. This feat requires the full attack action.
Special: You cannot use this feat when wielding a double weapon, light weapon or two-handed weapon and
you cannot combine the extra attack gained from this feat with any other feat or ability that provides an extra
attack except for Cleave and similar feats.

TWO-WEAPON CLEAVE [General, Fighter]
You can follow through with either weapon.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, Two-weapon Fighting
Benefit: When using the cleave feat you may make your follow up attack with any melee weapon you are
wielding.

TWO-WEAPON DEFENSE [General, Fighter]
You gain a defensive bonus when fighting with two weapons.
Prerequisite: Dex 15, Two-weapon Fighting
Benefit: When wielding a double weapon or two weapons (not including natural weapons or unarmed
strikes), you gain a +1 shield bonus to your AC. When you are fighting defensively or using the total defense
action, this shield bonus increases to +2.
Special: A fighter may select Two-Weapon Defense as one of his fighter bonus feats.

TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING [General, Fighter]
You can use two weapons with a reduced penalty.
Benefit: Your penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by 2.

TWO-WEAPON HARMONY [General, Fighter]
Your mastery of this style allows you to act with both weapons in harmony.
Prerequisite: Dex 15, Two-weapon Fighting, Improved Two-weapon Fighting, Base attack bonus +9
Benefit: Once per round, when fighting with two weapons and making an attack of opportunity or a standard
attack you may attack once with your off-hand weapon (with the normal penalties) in addition to the single
attack you are normally allowed. If making an attack of opportunity both attacks must be directed at the
opponent who triggered the attack.
Normal: You may only make one attack when using an attack of opportunity or standard attack action.

TWO-WEAPON REND [Epic, Fighter]
You can perform a rend maneuver when using two weapons.
Prerequisite: Dex 15, Base attack bonus +9, Improved Two-weapon Fighting, Two-weapon Fighting
Benefit: If you hits an opponent with a weapon in each hand in the same round, you may automatically rend
the opponent. This deals additional damage equal to the base damage of the smaller weapon plus 1 1/2
times your Strength modifier. Base weapon damage includes an enhancement bonus on damage, if any.
You can only rend once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks your make.

TYPHOON ATTACK [General, Fighter]
By jumping headlong into battle you can strike multiple opponents.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Jump 6 ranks, Tumble 4 ranks, Combat Reflexes
Benefit: In order to use this feat you must be unarmed, fighting with two weapons, or using a double weapon.
While charging, if you successfully hit your opponent you may immediately make another attack at your
highest base attack bonus against another target in your threatened area using what would normally be your
off-hand weapon (if applicable).

ULTIMATE CLEAVE [General, Fighter]
You can transfer some of the damage you inflict on a powerful blow to your next cleave attack.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Power Attack, Cleave, Base attack bonus +6
Benefit: Once per round when using your Cleave or Great Cleave feats, all damage inflicted beyond that
needed to drop your opponent is gained as a damage bonus on your extra cleave attack. This damage
bonus only applies against the opponent targeted by your extra cleave attack and is lost if this attack misses.
Example: Bron, a 6th level dwarven fighter with Cleave, Great Cleave and Ultimate Cleave, is in combat with
3 goblins (each with 6 hit points). Bron hits on his first attack, inflicts 12 points of damage and reduces the
first goblin to -6 hit points, triggering a cleave attack. Since he has Ultimate Cleave, he disembowels the first
goblin and gains a +5 damage bonus on his cleave attack (6-1 = 5). He slays the second goblin with this
attack, triggering another cleave attack, but does not gain an additional damage bonus because he's already
used Ultimate Cleave that round.

UNBALANCING FEINT [General, Fighter]
Your feint can unbalance your opponent.
Prerequisite: Int 15, Combat Expertise, Improved Feint, Vexing Feint, Base attack bonus +7
Benefit: When you feint in combat, your opponent is considered flat-footed until they take a move action to
regain their balance. Any ability that allows you to rise from a prone position to standing can also be used to
regain balance in this case.

UNBALANCING FIST [General, Fighter]
You can throw your enemy off balance with a single precise blow to a nerve center.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Base attack bonus +4
Benefit: Declare that you are using the feat before you make your attack roll. If you successfully strike your
opponent with an unarmed strike, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + ½ your level +Wis Modifier). In
addition to suffering normal damage, if the defender fails his saving throw, he is considered flat footed for 1
round. You may use Unbalancing Fist once per day for every four character levels, and no more than once
per round.

UNCANNY ACCURACY [Epic, Fighter]
You can hit targets you can not even see.
Prerequisite: Dex 21, Base attack bonus +11, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Improved Precise Shot, Spot
20 ranks
Benefit: Your ranged attacks ignore the miss chance granted to targets by total concealment. You must aim
your attacks at the correct square to gain advantage of this feat.
Normal: Without this feat, characters suffer a 50% miss chance when making a ranged attack against a
target with total concealment.
Special: A character with at least 11 levels of ranger can qualify for this feat even if he or she does not have
the prerequisites for it, but can only use it when wearing light or no armor.

UNCANNY REACTION [General]
You think so quickly on your feet, it almost seems supernatural. Often, you are moving before anyone else
knows what is happening.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Alertness, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes
Benefit: When rolling for initiative, you roll twice and take the highest result. Your initiative modifiers are then
added to the rolled number normally.

UNCANNY TACTICS [Stealth]
You are skilled at attacking with or avoiding sneak attacks versus skilled opponents.
Prerequisite: Improved Uncanny Dodge
Benefit: When calculating your level for using or overcoming "Improved Uncanny Dodge", add 4 to your level
for the check.
Normal: Improved Uncanny Dodge denies the attacking rogue the ability to sneak attack the target by
flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does

UP AND DOWN [General, Fighter]
You exploit the mechanical leverage of your long weapons.
Prerequisite: Improved Trip, Near And Far
Benefit: When using a weapon with reach, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all rolls when you make a
trip attack. If you fail in your trip attempt your opponent may not make a trip in return.
Normal: When you fail in a trip attempt, your opponent may attempt to trip you in return.

VENTRILOQUISM [General]
You have learned to throw your voice, making it appear to come from someplace else.
Prerequisite: Perform (comedy) 1 rank
Benefit: As a standard action, you can use the Perform (comedy) skill to make your voice appear to come
from another location. You must decide where you want your voice to appear to come from; the DC is equal
to the number of feet away you wish to throw your voice. If there is something there that moves in a manner
suggestive of speech or of making the sounds you are throwing, reduce the difficulty by 10. Listeners can try
to realize what you are doing with an opposed listen roll, but such a listen roll is subject to normal range
penalties.

VEXING FEINT [General, Fighter]
Your feinting technique has a longer lasting effect.
Prerequisite: Int 15, Combat Expertise, Improved Feint, Base attack bonus +5
Benefit: A successful feint denies your opponent their Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) until the end of your next
round.
Normal: A successful feint denies your opponent their dex bonus only for your next attack against them.

VIGOR OF THE STAG [General]
You can temporarily focus your energies on staying alive in difficult circumstances.
Prerequisite: Con 13, Great Fortitude
Benefit: Once per day as a swift action you can gain 1d4 temporary hit points per point of constitution bonus
for one minute.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times, each time enabling you to use it one more time per day,
however you can not use the feat more than once per minute.


WATCHMAN [General]
Through practice, training and experience, you are more alert and aware.
Benefit: You get a +1 bonus to Spot and Listen checks. In addition, Spot and Listen are always considered
class skills for you.


WAY OF THE HARE [General, Fighter]
You have mastered the art of the leaping attack.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1, Dex 13, Jump 1 rank
Benefit: You gain a +4 attack bonus on any attack made while leaping five feet or more just prior to making
an attack. The jump must be made in the same round as the attack, the idea being that you are attacking as
you come down. Should you fail your jump check you fall prone at the end of the jump and do not gain an
attack bonus from this feat.


WEAPON AND SHIELD OFFENSIVE HARMONY [General, Fighter]
You have mastered the art of using your shield as a weapon, to complement your blade.
Prerequisite: Str 13, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, Base attack bonus +5
Benefit: When using a melee weapon and shield with proficiency, you can attack with both as if you had the
benefits of the Two-Weapon Fighting feat. In addition, any successful attack with your shield inflicts +1
damage, or grants an additional +2 bonus to your Strength check for a special combat maneuver requiring
one (e.g. during a Bull Rush or Overrun).
Notes: Light shields are usable as light martial melee weapons and heavy shields as one-handed martial
melee weapons. However, when using your shield in this manner you do not gain the AC benefits it would
otherwise give you during that round.

WEAPON FINESSE [General, Fighter]
You can use certain weapons with finesse instead of force.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1
Benefit: With a light weapon, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for a creature of your size category, you
may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its
armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.
Special: A fighter may select Weapon Finesse as one of his fighter bonus feats. Natural weapons are always
considered light weapons.

WEAPON FOCUS [General, Fighter]
Choose one type of weapon. You can also choose unarmed strike or grapple (or ray, if you are a spellcaster)
as your weapon for purposes of this feat.
Prerequisite: Proficiency With Selected Weapon, Base attack bonus +1
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies
to a new type of weapon. A fighter may select Weapon Focus as one of his fighter bonus feats. He must
have Weapon Focus with a weapon to gain the Weapon Specialization feat for that weapon.

WEAPON JUGGLE [General, Fighter]
You can change and pick up weapons as a free action.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Quick Draw, Sleight Of Hand 1 rank
Benefit: You can juggle weapons and similarly sized objects during combat. You can draw, sheathe, or shift
them from hand to hand as a free action. You can even pick them up from the ground as a free action, as
long as you can kick at them. You can do this at the start and end of your turn, but not on somebody else's
turn or in the middle of an attack sequence. These actions never trigger attacks of opportunity.

WEAPON MASTERY [Special, Fighter]
You have perfected the art of using a particular weapon.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Base Attack bonus +12
Benefit: Choose one weapon for which you have Weapon Specialization and Improved Critical that is not a
natural weapon. When using a weapon of that type the base weapon damage is increased as if it were once
size category larger.
Special: You can take this feat multiple times; its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat it applies
to a new weapon.

WEAPON RELIABILITY [General, Fighter]
Your skill with your chosen weapon means that you don't miss the easy ones.
Prerequisite: Weapon Proficiency, Weapon Focus, Base attack bonus +10
Benefit: Choose one weapon with which you have Weapon Focus. With your chosen weapon, a one is not
an automatic miss for you.

WEAPON SPECIALIZATION [Special, Fighter]
Choose one type of weapon for which you have already selected the Weapon Focus feat. You can also
choose unarmed strike or grapple as your weapon for purposes of this feat. You deal extra damage when
using this weapon.
Prerequisite: Proficiency With Selected Weapon, Weapon Focus With Selected Weapon, Fighter level 4th
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on all damage rolls you make using the selected weapon.
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies
to a new type of weapon. A fighter may select Weapon Specialization as one of his fighter bonus feats.

WEAPON TRICKS [General, Fighter]
You can change the type of damage you do with melee weapons.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus
Benefit: Many types of melee weapons can conceivably do different types of damage. Examples are swords
(could do slashing and bludgeoning, even piercing), picks (could do bludgeoning or piercing) and single-
edged or bludgeon-backed axes (could do slashing and bludgeoning). When wielding such a weapon that
you have Weapon Focus with, you can opt to alter its damage type without penalty. For example, you can
choose to attack zombies with the flat of a sword in order to do bludgeoning damage, avoiding their damage
reduction versus slashing weapons.
Notes: The DM is the final arbiter on what types of damage a weapon can do, based on the illustration,
common sense and knowledge on how these weapons are used in real life. If in doubt, go with your gut
feeling. Many weapons are already listed as doing two or even all three types of damage and so do not
require this feat.

WHEELING ATTACK [General, Fighter]
You can attack at any point along your mount's path.
Prerequisite: Mounted Combat, Ride 1 rank
Benefit: Your mount may make a double move and you can still make an attack at any point along your path
of movement at no extra penalty. This move cannot be a charge. The target of your attack does not receive
an attack of opportunity when you move through their threat range.
Notes: This represents the hit-and-run tactics of light cavalry.

WHIRLWIND ATTACK [General, Fighter]
You can attack everyone within reach.
Prerequisite: Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Combat Expertise, Base attack bonus +4, Dex 13, Int 13
Benefit: When you use the full attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one
melee attack at your full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. When you use the
Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.
Special: A fighter may select Whirlwind Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.


WILD RIDER [General, Fighter]
You can ride anything, in any fashion
Prerequisite: Ride 1 rank
Benefit: You do not suffer the normal -5 penalties when riding ill-suited mounts or bareback.

WILLOW STEP [General, Fighter]
You may charge past your enemies with a graceful dancing step.
Prerequisite: Dex 15, Tumble 10 ranks, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack
Benefit: When charging, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again
(continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can't exceed double your
speed. You do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent that you attack. You may move
through your targets space when doing this.

WOODSCRAFT [General]
Your hunches and guesses tend to be more accurate about the world around you.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (Nature) checks and Survival checks.

ZONE OF DEFLECTION [General, Fighter]
You may deflect any missile that passes close to you.
Prerequisite: Dex 13, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike
Benefit: Whenever a missile passes within your threatened area, you have the option of using your Deflect
Arrows feat to try and intercept it, even if you are not the intended target. You may not otherwise exceed the
limits of Deflect Arrows.
